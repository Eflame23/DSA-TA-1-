📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the concept of merging two arrays and sorting them using an interactive visualization built with Python Tkinter.
The application allows users to:

Merge two arrays into one

Sort arrays (individually or after merging)

Reset arrays back to original values

Generate random arrays for experimentation

This project was developed as part of the DSA Term Assessment (Unit I & II).

🧩 Concept

The algorithm works in two main steps:

Merge: Combines Array A and Array B into one single array.

Sort: Rearranges the merged array (or individual arrays) into ascending order.

Example:

Array A = [3, 7, 11, 15, 20]  
Array B = [4, 8, 12, 16, 25]  

Merged = [3, 7, 11, 15, 20, 4, 8, 12, 16, 25]  
Sorted = [3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 25]

🎨 Features
